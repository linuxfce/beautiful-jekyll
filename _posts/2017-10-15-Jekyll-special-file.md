I quote [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) of the officail site of Jekyll.

The front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as specail file.

The front matter must be the first thing int the file and must take the from of valid YAML set between triple-dashed line
