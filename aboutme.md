<h3 class='text-center'>Light Technician<br>
(1989 – 1994 then 1997 to 1998)<br>
Dance Company of Lisbon<br> (Costa do Castelo, Lisbon, Portugal)</h3>

<p> Install all the lights, projectors, follow-spots when touring with the Company around Portugal & other countries, when in Lisbon at the C.D.L. headquarters assist choreographers when in workshops with ideas and other details, repair all our material & create Props to use on stage, from all the jobs I did this this was the one I love the most. From 1997 to 1998 got back to the Dance Company, I work almost for free because it was in serious trouble, no money, I went to live there (an old palace that over the years I help to restore with the aid of Lisbon Council & the friends of C.D.L.).</p>

 <h3 class='text-center'>Skills</h3>

<p>I repair PC, Laptop computers & Android Phones. Good with Windows & Linux systems, hardware or software with very good knowledge of using the Linux Terminal (Windows command line). I do small repairs on Android phones (updates, install or broken screens). I repair computers free of charge to all my neighbors too.
<br>
<b>Basic Knowledge of HTML,CSS & JavaScript</b>. I know how to design & maintain basic websites from scratch (static & dynamic pages) on web hosting or GitHub pages (some skills with Git). I also use Bootstrap, Atom text editor, JQuery (beginner). I’m doing a free code course online at FreeCodeCamp.</p>

I'm also trying to work with [Firefox](http://tinyurl.com/o4zpxgb) new [WebExtensions API](http://tinyurl.com/oquzmyx), in order to migrate some of my old addons, build with the old sdk, to the new **WebExtensions API**, a cross-browser system for developing extensions. To a large extent the system is compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera and the W3C Draft Community Group. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run in Firefox or Microsoft Edge with just a few changes. The API is also fully compatible with multiprocess Firefox. I'm having all kinds of issues with this, but, on the other hand that was the way I start up with Node.Js with Express &amp; to learn how to build the software for a local Library maintain by volunteers, I'm experimenting to this also with the **Django framework** in my localhost on my Desktop PC.

<br>

<p> Good skills with Photoshop, Darktable ,Gimp, Virtualbox, etc. Hardware & Software installation, troubleshooting, updates, malware, virus, etc.<br>
