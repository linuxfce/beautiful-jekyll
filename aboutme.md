  I Start working when I was 12 years old, <mark>1978</mark>, I did all kinds of work, from <mark>1988 to 1994</mark> I work at Lisbon Dance Company (Companhia de Dança de Lisboa) as a light Technician/Repair all our material &amp; Create Props to use on stage, from all the previous jobs I had, this was the one I love the most. From <mark>1995-97</mark> work as Volunteer to help street kids like me who live or pass all day outside because their parents where working all day. <mark>1997-1999</mark> got back to the Dance Company,I work almost for free because it was in serious trouble, no money, I went to live there (an old palace that over the years I help to restore with the aid of Lisbon Council).In the year <mark>2000, I came to England</mark> looking for a better life, I work at night at New Convent Garden Market, Vauxhall, loading delivery Vans with fruit &amp; vegetables from <mark>August to November (2000)</mark> &amp; that's when I got very ill and thanks to the NHS who save my life and gave me a house (2005) to live, money to eat &amp; for the 1st time in my life I had &amp; free health care (G.P., Pills, etc), only now, <mark>2017</mark>, I'm at the end of this unspoken journey. In this moment, <mark>November 2017</mark>, I'm finishing a liver treatment at King's College, ends firsts days December 2017 (I had this desease for 20 years), I use a walking stick or if it's a long walk (more than 5,10m) I have to use a pair of crutches (in 1 year time I'll have an operation to my right foot in order to be able to walk again). I like to help other people and contribute for us to have a better society.

  So, since <mark>2005 till today,November 2017</mark> I had to learn how to use a PC, then I start learning how to code &amp; today I'm proud to call myself a Web Developer which is not really true, I'm still learning HTML, CSS (SASS), JScritp, JQuery, Bootstrap, Node.Js, Markdown syntax, Jekill, GitHub &amp; Git, etc. I can do simple websites (like this one) or blogs that my friends &amp; neighbours can easily maintain without any knowledge of C.M. Systems, Databases, coding or even know how to host their own website &amp; free of Ads.
  I also repair all Windows or Linux systems, <b>Desktop Computers, Laptops &amp; Tablets</b> free of charge to all my neighbours &amp; friends. I never had a complaint &amp; only once I wasn't able to reapair a Samsung ChromeBook due to the lack of support from Samsung in disclosing their Service manual, only for their technicians if you want to pay them the ransom (repair) money.

 I also work w/ PShop CS6 (W7 on [VirtualBox]( https://www.virtualbox.org/)), [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/), [UFRaw](http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/), [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/), [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/) on [Linux 18.2 Sonya xfce](https://linuxmint.com/rel_sonya_xfce.php), which is my favourite Linux system, and many others...

 I read a lot, I like to play the guitar &amp; I'm good with kids at least that's what other people &amp; neighbours say, coming from me will be pretentious ...

 I'm also trying to work with [Firefox](http://tinyurl.com/o4zpxgb) new [WebExtensions API](http://tinyurl.com/oquzmyx), in order to migrate some of my old addons, build with the old sdk, to the new **WebExtensions API**, a cross-browser system for developing extensions. To a large extent the system is compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera and the W3C Draft Community Group. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run in Firefox or Microsoft Edge with just a few changes. The API is also fully compatible with multiprocess Firefox. I'm having all kinds of issues with this, but, on the other hand that was the way I start up with Node.Js with Express &amp; to learn how to build the software for a local Library maintain by volunteers, I'm experimenting to this also with the **Django framework** in my localhost on my Desktop PC.

   Thanks for (hopefully not) wasting your time reading this page, any suggestions just make a pull request on my [GitHub Acc](https://github.com/linuxfce) .
